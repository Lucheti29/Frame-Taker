# Frame-Taker
## Description

The "Frame-Taker" is a Python-based project designed to capture frames from a video and remove duplicate frames, optimizing the process of creating screenshots or benchmarks during application research and testing. This tool provides a convenient and efficient way to analyze recorded video content by extracting unique frames, eliminating redundant information, and generating a more concise representation of the video footage.

The tool is particularly useful for researchers, developers, and testers who record application experiences for evaluation and need a streamlined approach to extract meaningful frames from videos.
